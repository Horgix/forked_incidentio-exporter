This is an custom Prometheus Exporter for the awesome https://incident.io incident management solution.

Allows your business to monitor all types of pre-configured incidents.
Improve your incident management workflow and better understand the usage of your [incident.io](https://incident.io) installation.

## ⚙️ Metrics

The Incident.io Prometheus Exporter supports all basic pre-configured types of incidents available in [incident.io](https://incident.io).

| Name                                  | Label    | Description                                               |
|---------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `incidentio_incidents_total_count`    |          | Total count of incidents for the incident.io installation |
| `incidentio_incidents_severity_count` | severity | Total count of incidents labeled per severity             |
| `incidentio_incidents_status_count`   | status   | Total count of incidents labeled per status               |

## 🚀 Deployment

> IMPORTANT: You have to provide the "INCIDENTIO_API_KEY="<MY_API_KEY>" environment variable to your deployment for the Incident.io Prometheus Exporter to work.
> This API key needs _at least_ the `View data, like public incidents and organisation settings` permission in order to be able to fetch the meaningful information for the metrics collection.
